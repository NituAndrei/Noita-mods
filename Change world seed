Working with original release version:
0) Go to *username*\AppData\LocalLow\Nolla_Games_Noita\save00
1) Delete everything except for the folders "persistent" and "stats"
2) Open noita.exe with your debugger of choice
3) Make sure the game doesn't actually start when you open it with the debugger (if using x96dbg, make sure "Entry breakpoint" is checked)
4) Set breakpoint at instruction 00FCC113 (mov dword ptr ds:[17FC638],eax)
5) Run to breakpoint
6) Set eax to desired seed
